# Lani

## What
- Lani is a simple dashboard for tracking arriving flights into Honolulu.

## Why
- Lani was created to assist in predicting tourist arrivals to hotels and to estimate the remaining work for the day.
- While similar such dashboards already exist, many of them are large, cumbersome, and often contain more information than is needed. Which makes them difficult to use.

- Created by Taylor Reid in 2024
