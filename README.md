# Lani

## What
- Lani is a simple dashboard for tracking arriving flights into Honolulu.

## Why
- Lani was created to assist in predicting tourist arrivals to hotels and to estimate the remaining work for the day for hotel arrival staff.
- While similar such dashboards already exist, many of them are large, cumbersome, and often contain more information than is needed. Which makes them difficult to use.

## Who
- Created in 2024 by Taylor Reid for Hawaii's hotel workers.

## Where
- Made in Hawaii for Hawaii ![Hawaii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylorsreid/lani/main/src/assets/Flag_of_Hawaii.svg)

## How
  A demonstration account is available to test the app. The email is "demouser@example.com" and the password is "password".
  Unfortunately due to the cost of using the FlightAware AeroAPI, the demo account is restricted to using static test data and will not give realtime flight information.
  If you would like a real account, please fill out the registration form on the website along with an explanation of need.
